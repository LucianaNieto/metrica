## Performance metrics available in *metrica*

The **metrica** package contains +40 functions. Two arguments are 
always required: `observed`(Oi; a.k.a. actual, measured, truth, target)
and `predicted` (Pi; a.k.a. simulated, fitted) values. Also, there is an optional
`data` arg. that allows to call an existing data frame containing both observed
and predicted vectors. <br/>

Some functions, also require to define axis `orientation`, such as the slope of 
linear regression describing the bivariate scatter. Current included functions
cover the world of "regression error" metrics (i.e. prediction performance for 
continuous variables). Classification error metrics coming soon. <br/>

Always keep in mind that predicted values should come from out-of-bag samples 
(unseen by training set) to avoid overestimation of prediction performance. <br/>


| #|Metric | Definition | Details | Formula |
| --|------ | ---------------|-------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| A| `RSS` | Residual sum of squares (a.k.a. as sum of squares) | The sum of squared differences between predicted and observed values. It represents the base of many error metrics using squared scale such as the MSE |![equation](formulae/A.RSS.gif) |
| B| `TSS` | Total sum of squares | The sum of the squared differences between the observations and its mean. It is used as a reference error, for example, to estimate explained variance |![equation](formulae/B.TSS.gif)|
| C| `var_u` | Sample variance, uncorrected | The mean of sum of squared differences between values of an `x` and its mean (divided by n, not n-1)|![equation](formulae/C.var.u.gif)|
| D| `uSD` | Sample standard deviation, uncorrected | The square root of the mean of sum of squared differences between values of an `x` and its mean (divided by n, not n-1)|![equation](formulae/D.uSD.gif)| 
| 1| `B0` | Intercept of SMA regression | SMA is a symmetric linear regression (invariant results/interpretation to axis orientation) recommended to describe the bivariate scatter instead of OLS regression (classic linear model, which results vary with the axis orientation). B0 could be used to test agreement along with B1 (H0: B0 = 0, B1 = 1)|![equation](formulae/1.B0.gif)| 
| 2| `B1` | Slope of SMA regression |  SMA is a symmetric linear regression (invariant results/interpretation to axis orientation) recommended to describe the bivariate scatter instead of OLS regression (classic linear model, which results vary with the axis orientation). B1 could be used to test isometry of the PO scatter (H0: B1 = 1). B1 also represents the ratio of standard deviations (So and Sp) |![equation](formulae/2.B1.gif)| 
| 3| `r` | Pearson's correlation coefficient |  Strength of linear association between P and O. However, it measures "precision" but no accuracy. |![equation](formulae/3.r.gif)| 
| 4| `R2` | Coefficient of determination |  Strength of linear association between P and O. However, it measures "precision" but no accuracy |![equation](formulae/4.R2.gif)| 
| 5| `Xa` | Accuracy coefficient | Measures accuracy. Used to adjust the precision measured by `r` to estimate agreement |![equation](formulae/5.Xa.gif)| 
| 6| `CCC` | Concordance correlation coefficient | Tests agreement. It presents both precision (r) and accuracy (Xa) components. Easy to interpret |![equation](formulae/6.CCC.gif)|
| 7| `MAE` | Mean Absolute Error |  Measures both lack of accuracy and precision in absolute scale. It keeps the same units than the response variable. Less sensitive to outliers than the MSE or RMSE |![equation](formulae/7.MAE.gif)| 
| 8| `RMAE` | Relative Mean Absolute Error |  Normalizes the MAE with respect to the mean of observations |![equation](formulae/8.RMAE.gif)| 
| 9| `MAPE` | Mean Absolute Percentage Error |  Percentage units (independent scale). Easy to explain and to compare performance across models with different response variables. Asymmetric and unbounded. |![equation](formulae/9.MAPE.gif)| 
| 10| `SMAPE` | Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error |  SMAPE tackles the asymmetry issues of MAPE and includes lower (0%) and upper (200%) bounds. |![equation](formulae/10.SMAPE.gif)|

| 13| `MBE` | Mean Bias Error |  Main bias error metric. Same units as the response variable. Related to differences between means of predictions and observations. Negative values indicate overestimation. Positive values indicate underestimation. Unbounded. |![equation](formulae/13.MBE.gif) |
| 14| `PBE` | Percentage Bias Error |  Useful to identify systematic over or under predictions. Percentage units. As the MBE, PBE negative values indicate overestimation, while positive values indicate underestimation. Unbounded.| ![equation](formulae/14.PBE.gif) |
