## Performance metrics available in *metrica*

The **metrica** package compiles +80 functions to assess regression (continuous) 
and classification (categorical) prediction performance from multiple perspectives. <br/> 

For regression models, it includes 4 plotting functions (scatter, tiles, density, 
& Bland-Altman plots), and 48 prediction performance scores including error metrics 
(MBE, MAE, RAE, RMAE, MAPE, SMAPE, MSE, RMSE, RRMSE, RSR, PBE, iqRMSE), 
model efficiency (NSE, E1, Erel, KGE), indices of agreement (d, d1, d1r, RAC, AC,
lambda), goodness of fit (r, R2, RSS, TSS, RSE), adjusted correlation coefficients
(CCC, Xa, distance correlation-dcorr-), error decomposition (MLA, MLP, PLA, PLP, 
PAB, PPB, SB, SDSD, LCS, Ub, Uc, Ue), variability (uSD, var_u), and symmetric 
regression coefficients (B0_sma, B1_sma). Specifically for time-series 
predictions, `metrica` also includes the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). <br/>

For classification (binomial and multinomial) tasks, it includes a function to 
visualize the confusion matrix using ggplot2, and 27 functions of prediction 
scores including: accuracy, error rate, precision, recall, specificity, 
balanced accuracy, F-score, adjusted F-score, G-mean, Bookmaker Informedness 
(Youden's J-index), Markedness (deltaP), Matthews Correlation Coefficient, 
khat or Cohen's Kappa, negative predictive value, positive and negative 
likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, prevalence, critical success index, 
false positive rate, false negative rate, false detection rate, false omission 
rate, and area under the ROC curve. <br/>

Always keep in mind the concept of "cross-validation" since predicted values 
should come from out-of-bag samples (unseen by training set) to avoid 
overestimation of the prediction performance. <br/>

## Core functions' arguments. <br/>

There are two basic arguments common to all `metrica` functions: 
(i) `obs`(Oi; observed, a.k.a. actual, measured, truth, target, label), and 
(ii) `pred` (Pi; predicted, a.k.a. simulated, fitted, modeled,  estimate) values. <br/>

Optional arguments include `data` that allows to call an existing data frame 
containing both observed and predicted vectors, and `tidy`, which controls the 
type of output as a list (tidy = FALSE) or as a data.frame (tidy = TRUE). <br/>

For regression, some specific functions for regression also require to define 
the axis `orientation`. For example, the slope of the symmetric linear regression 
describing the bivariate scatter (SMA). <br/>

For binary classification (two classes), functions also require to check the 
`pos_level` arg., which indicates the alphanumeric order of the "positive level".
Normally, the most common binary denominations are c(0,1), c("Negative", "Positive"), 
c("FALSE", "TRUE"), so the default pos_level = 2 (1, "Positive", "TRUE"). However, 
other cases are also possible, such as c("Crop", "NoCrop") for which the user
needs to specify pos_level = 1. <br/>

For multiclass classification tasks, some functions present the `atom` arg. (logical
TRUE / FALSE), which controls the output to be an overall average estimate across
all classes, or a class-wise estimate. For example, user might be interested in 
obtaining estimates of precision and recall for each possible class of the prediction. <br/>

| r46| `dcorr` | Distance correlation | Measures the dependency between to random vectors. Compared to Pearson's `r`, it offers the advantage of considering both linear and nonlinear association patterns. It is based on a matrix of centered Euclidean distances compared to the distance of many shuffles of the data. It is dimensionless, bounded [0;1], and symmetric. `dcorr = 0` characterizes independence between vectors. The closest to 1 the better. A disadvantage for the predicted-observed case is that values can be negatively correlated but producing a `dcorr` close to 1. Székely (2007) |  $dcorr = \sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{V}^2_n~(\mathbf{P,O})}{ {\sqrt{\mathcal{V}^2_n (\mathbf{P}) \mathcal{V}^2_n(\mathbf{O})} } }}$ See Székely (2007) for full details |

It is based on the "mutual information" concept of information theory, which measures the mutual dependence between two variables. It is dimensionless (normalized), bounded [0;1], and symmetric. Reshef et al. (2011) |  See Reshef et al. 2011 |
| r48| `MASE` | Mean Absolute Scaled Error | The `MASE` is especially well suited for time series predictions, as it scales (or normalize) the error based on _in-sample_ MAE from the naive forecast method (a.k.a. random walk). It is dimensionless (normalized) and symmetric. The reference score is MASE = 1, which indicates that the model performs the same than a naive forecast (error with respect to previous historical observation). MASE <1 indicates that the model performs better than naive forecast, and MASE > 1 indicates a bad performance of the predictions. See Hyndman & Koehler (2006) |  $MASE = \frac{1}{n}(\frac{|O_i-P_i|}{ \frac{1}{T-1} \sum^T_{t=2}~|O_t - O_{t-1}| })$ |

## 2. Classification metrics* (categorical variables)
_Note: All classification functions automatically recognize the number of classes and adjust estimations for binary or multiclass cases. However, for binary classification tasks, the user would need to check the alphanumeric order of the level considered as positive. By default "pos_level = 2" based on the most common denominations being c(0,1), c("Negative","Positive"), c("TRUE", "FALSE")._ <br/>

| #|Metric | Definition | Details | Formula |
| --|------ | ---------------|------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| c1| `accuracy` | Accuracy | It is the most commonly used metric to evaluate classification quality. It represents the number of corrected classified cases with respect to all cases. However, be aware that this metric does not cover all aspects about classification quality. When classes are uneven in number, it may not be a reliable metric. | $accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$|
| c2| `error_rate` | Error Rate | It represents the complement of accuracy. It could vary between 0 and 1. Being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $error~rate = \frac{FP+FN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$|
| c3| `precision` | Precision | Also known as positive predictive value (PPV), it represents the proportion of well classified cases with respect to the total of cases predicted with a given class (multinomial) or the true class (binomial)  | $precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$|
| c4| `recall` | Recall | Also known as sensitivity, hit rate, or true positive rate (TPR) for binary cases. It represents the proportion of well predicted cases with respect to the total number of observed cases for a given class (multinomial) or the positive class (binomial) | $recall = \frac{TP}{P} = 1 - FNR$| 
| c5| `specificity` | Specificity | Also known as selectivity or true negative rate (TNR). It represents the proportion of well classified negative values with respect to the total number of actual negatives  | $specificity = \frac{TN}{N} = 1 - FPR$|
| c6| `balacc` | Balanced Accuracy | This metric is especially useful when the number of observations across classes is imbalanced | $b.accuracy = \frac{recall + specificity}{2}$|
| c7| `fscore` | F-score | F1-score, F-measure | $fscore = \frac{(1 + B ^ 2) * precision * recall}{(B ^ 2 * precision) + recall)}$|
| c8| `agf` | Adjusted F-score | The agf adjusts the fscore for datasets with imbalanced classes | $agf = \sqrt{F_2 * invF_{0.5}}$, where $F_2 = 5 * \frac{recall~*~precision}{(4*recall)~+~precision}$, and $invF_{0.5} = (\frac{5}{4}) * \frac{recall~*~precision}{(0.5^2 ~*~ recall)~+~precision}$|
| c9| `gmean` | G-mean | The Geometric Mean (gmean) is a measure that considers a balance between the performance of both majority and minority classes. The higher the value the lower the risk of over-fitting of negative and under-fitting of positive classes | $gmean = \sqrt{recall~*~specificity}$|
| c10| `khat` | K-hat or Cohen's Kappa Coefficient | The khat is considered a more robust metric than the classic `accuracy`. It normalizes the accuracy by the possibility of agreement by chance. It is positively bounded to 1, but it is not negatively bounded. The closer to 1, the better the classification quality | $khat = \frac{2 * (TP * TN - FN * FP)}{(TP+FP) * (FP+TN) + (TP+FN) * (FN + TN)}$|
| c11| `mcc` | Matthews Correlation Coefficient | Also known as phi-coefficient. It is particularly useful when the number of observations belonging to each class is uneven. It varies between 0-1, being 0 the worst and 1 the best. Currently, the mcc estimation is only available for binary cases (two classes) | $mcc = \frac{TP * TN - FP * FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP) * (TP+FN) * (TN+FP) * (TN+FN)}}$|
| c12| `fmi` | Fowlkes-Mallows Index | The fmi is a metric that measures the similarity between two clusters (predicted and observed). It is equivalent to the square root of the product between precision (PPV) and recall (TPR). It varies between 0-1, being 0 the worst and 1 the best.  | $fmi = \sqrt{precision * recall} = \sqrt{PPV * TPR}$ |
| c13| `bmi`| Informedness | Also known as the Bookmaker Informedness, or as the Youden's J-index. It is a suitable metric when the number of cases for each class is uneven. It varies between| $bmi = recall + specificity -1 = TPR + TNR - 1 = \frac{FP+FN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$|
| c14| `posLr` | Positive Likelihood Ratio | The posLr, also known as LR(+) represents the odds of obtaining a positive prediction for actual positives. | $posLr = \frac{recall}{1+specificity} = \frac{TPR}{FPR}$|
| c15| `negLr` | Negative Likelihood Ratio | The negLr, also known as LR(-) indicates the odds of obtaining a negative prediction for actual positives (or non-negatives in multiclass) relative to the probability of actual negatives of obtaining a negative prediction | $negLr = \frac{1-recall}{specificity} = \frac{FNR}{TNR}$|
| c16| `dor` | Diagnostic Odds Ratio | The dor is a metric summarizing the effectiveness of classification. It represents the odds of a positive case obtaining a positive prediction result with respect to the odds of actual negatives obtaining a positive result| $dor = \frac{posLr}{negLr}$|
| c17| `npv` | Negative predictive Value | It represents the complement of accuracy. It could vary between 0 and 1. Being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $npv = \frac{TP}{PP} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$|
| c18| `FPR` | False Positive Rate | It represents the complement of `specificity`. It could vary between 0 and 1. The lower the better. | $FPR = 1 - specificity = 1 - TNR = \frac{FP}{N}$|
| c19| `FNR` | False Negative Rate | It represents the complement of `recall`. It could vary between 0 and 1. The lower the better. | $FNR = 1 - recall = 1 - TPR = \frac{FN}{P}$|
| c20| `FDR` | False Detection Rate | It represents the complement of `precision` (or positive predictive value -`PPV`-). It could vary between 0 and 1, being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $FDR = 1 - precision = \frac{FP}{PP} = \frac{FP}{TP + FP}$|
| c21| `FOR` | False Omission Rate | It represents the complement of the `npv`. It could vary between 0 and 1, being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $FOR = 1 - npv = \frac{FN}{PN} = \frac{FN}{TN + FN}$|
| c22| `preval` | Error Rate | It represents the complement of accuracy. It could vary between 0 and 1. Being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $error~rate = \frac{FP+FN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$|
| c23| `preval_t` | Error Rate | It represents the complement of accuracy. It could vary between 0 and 1. Being 0 the best and 1 the worst | $error~rate = \frac{FP+FN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$|
| c24| `csi` | Critical Success Index | The `csi` is also known as the threat score (TS). It could vary between 0 and 1, being 0 the worst and 1 the best | $csi = \frac{TP}{TP+FP+TN}$|
| c25| `deltap` | Markedness or deltap | The `deltap` is a metric that quantifies the probability that a condition is marked by the predictor with respect to a random chance | $deltap = precision+npv-1 = PPV + NPV -1$|
| c26| `AUC_roc` | Area Under the Curve | The `AUC_roc` estimates the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve following the trapezoid approach. It bounded between 0 and 1. The closet to 1 the better. AUC_roc = 0.5 means the models predictions are the same than a random classifier. | $AUC_{roc} = precision+npv-1 = PPV + NPV -1$|
