The goal of the *metrica* package is to offer users of point-forecast models a toolbox with error metrics accounting for different aspects of the agreement between predicted and observed values.

## Installation

You can install the released version of metrica from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("metrica")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adriancorrendo/metrica")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(metrica)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, or images, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
pre <- metrica::wheat$pre
obs <- metrica::wheat$obs

scatter.plot <- metrica_plot(x = obs, y = pre)

scatter.plot <- scatter.plot +
  ggplot2::theme_bw()+
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Observed values", y = "Predicted values")+
  ggplot2::coord_fixed(xlim = c(round(min(c(min(pre), min(obs)))),round(max(c(max(pre), max(obs))))),
                       ylim = c(round(min(c(min(pre), min(obs)))),
                                round(max(c(max(pre), max(obs))))))
  
scatter.plot

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
