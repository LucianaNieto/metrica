# metrica 1.2.0

* This is the second release of the metrica package.

New features:

Data: a new (Optional) arg. called "data" is included for all functions,
which serves to call an existing data frame containing the predicted-observed data.
This facilitates passing the functions to multiple and nested data frames at once 
using mapping functions.

APSIM: includes two new functions to read APSIM output files from APSIM Classic ["*.out", 
import.apsim.out()] and APSIM NextGen ["*.db", import.apsim.db()].
